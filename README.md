#Data_cleaning of the messiest dataset.

* The first thing I did was to check details of the dataset, like getting the shape, the null values per column.
* Checked the similarity in columns to know which one to drop, also checked for the percentage of missing values in columns if they are more than 50% so as to drop them, after this I had to drop the irrelevance columns.
* Renamed the columns to make them callable.
* The dataset is a proven messy one so I proceed to replaced different characters per columns.
* Checked and Converted some columns to their normal data types.
* Filled the missing values base on values from each columns.
* I proceed to complete a hrf values that was not inputted correctly and I did that base on the values in hrf formula column.
